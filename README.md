# ADML---Climate-Parameters-Forecasting-
Climate Parameters Forecasting Project
Overview
This repository is dedicated to exploring the Daily Delhi Climate dataset through advanced data visualization techniques to uncover patterns and trends in Delhi's climate. 
The dataset is a compilation of several key meteorological variables that provide insights into the local weather dynamics. Our primary focus is on leveraging this data for weather
forecasting, with a specific emphasis on humidity, a critical factor in Delhi's climatic conditions.

Dataset Description
The dataset brings together 1,576 daily observations, collated from both training and test sets, spanning across 5 variables that characterize the weather patterns of Delhi. The variables included are:

Mean Temperature (meantemp): The average temperature recorded per day.
Humidity: The average relative humidity percentage for each day.
Wind Speed: The daily average wind speed measured in kilometers per hour.
Mean Pressure: The daily average atmospheric pressure in hectopascals (hPa).
